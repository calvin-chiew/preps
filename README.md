preps
=====
A particle simulation to detect collision and to identify collided particles' velocities and positions.

Plans
=====
1. Develop physic behaviour of particle on the web browser.
2. Write 2D web graphics language, (gl) using javascript.
3. Integrate particle's code into web graphic language.
4. Repeat step 1 until step 3 until getting good graphic and computation performance (>10k particles).
